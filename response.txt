What unique challenges do you foresee in developing and integrating AI regulatory agents for legal
compliance from a full-stack perspective? How would you address these challenges to make the system
robust and user-friendly?

Agent side:
In the law, if you detect issues at run-time, you're cooked. 
You have to guarantee correctness at compile-time.
If you can't guarantee correctness, you have to be able to estimate it.

Frontend:
How do you represent confidence?
How do you indicate cited sources? Gwerny
How do you prioritize and present citation confirmations?




Backend:
There's a significant body of jurisprudence affecting any regulatory guidance. 
The tax code is probably over 10M+ words, which would rip a 2M context window to shreds.
