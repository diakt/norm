What unique challenges do you foresee in developing and integrating AI regulatory agents for legal
compliance from a full-stack perspective? How would you address these challenges to make the system
robust and user-friendly?

To take a slightly brusque approach to this question, it might be useful to break it down into engineering sections.

At an agentic level, there's a huge body of regulatory law. 
While we'd never expect a context window to hold the entire tax code (16k pages?), regulation can be a wide body of work that is not easily connected.
There are a lot of ghosts in the shell where the spirit of the law matters as well as the formal interpretation (e.g. the tax code).
I think this has always been the purview of domain expertise and regulator relationships, though, so we just need to get a user to that point.
Additionally, law and legislation changes. There is no github or diff-watching hooks for nationwide zoning law, for example.
This type of CI/CD may cause more interesting problems than it should. I don't have a good answer yet. Perhaps we make it.

On the frontend, we're exposing a corpus of recommendations and citations that might not be necessarily comprehensive or accurate.
In trading, complicated approaches are often passed over in favor of simpler models that have a more explainable confidence interval.
Building a UI that accurately exposes and describes our degree of confidence in recomendation is (in my personal opinion) a hard problem.
We most likely need to expose some sort of confidence score for our recommendations, which is a very wide problem (multiple features to consider).
However, many users understand these systems should be taken with a grain of salt, there's a lot of current work across verticals in this topic, so approachable.


On the backend, we will be dealing with PDF hell. Tools are much better than they were but it's still a somewhat cursed format.
We hold extremely sensitive information and have to demonstrate a security posture bordering on paranoia. 
How long can we be expected to hold onto drafts and versions? 200 touches on a revision is standard in big law.
Additionally, I'd guess that we pass-through storage cost, but lawyers hang onto old work until the end of time, which could present issues.
Most problems in this domain are seem solved to me, but tuned implementation and pricing effective to user needs remains an implementation problem.
